% PART 1.  ABC Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Part of this homework is a m-file called ABCs_HomeworkOverview.m. Open
% this file in MATLAB and complete it according to the directions contained
% within.
%
% Once you are done, you can test your ABC file by running
% ABCs_pretest_HomeworkOverview() in the command window. Alternatively, you
% can right-click the file in the Current Directory window and click "Run
% File".  You cannot run or open the file by double clicking it.
%
% Files to Complete: 
%       - ABCs_HomeworkOverview.m
% ABCs File Testing:
%       - Run ABCs_pretest_HomeworkOverview.p by calling:
%               ABCs_pretest_HomeworkOverview()

% PART 2.  Drill Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Included with this homework is a file entitled "HW1 Drill Problems.pdf",
% and included within are instructions for 2 drill problems that cover the
% following major topic(s):
%	functions
%
% Follow the directions carefully and make sure file names as well as
% function headers are written exactly as described in the problem text. If
% your function headers are not written as specified, then you will receive
% an automatic zero for the problem.
%
% In this assignment, the drill problems will consist of simple 
% math/logic problems. All calculations should be done using MATLAB code.
% Do not compute any answer outside of MATLAB and then manually set the
% variable to the solution value. This is called hard-coding and will
% result in a score of 0 on each drill problem, not because we disallow it
% but because it is simply incorrect.
%
% Solution codes are provided for all drill problems. These files will be
% named as such: "<name of your code>_soln.p". They can be used just like
% any .m file that is written in matlab, except you are not able to open
% them. You may these files in conjunction with the test cases provided for
% each problem to check your work.
%
%
%==========================================================================
% PART 3. Testing Your Code
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% You may use the following test cases for each problem to test your code.
% The function call with the test-inputs is shown in the first line of each
% test case, and the correct outputs are then displayed in subsequent lines
% for each test case.
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Drill Problem 1: rectangleMath
%
%   [area1, perim1] = rectangleMath(5,5)
%       => area1 = 25
%          perim1 = 20
%
%   [area1, perim2] = rectangleMath(1,17)
%       => area2 = 17
%          perim2 = 36
%
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Drill Problem 2: backCalculate
%
%   B1 = backCalculate(3,5)
%       => B1 = 4
%
%   B2 = backCalculate(12,13)
%       => B2 = 5

% Congratulations, you've finished this homework assignment.  Before you
% turn in your code be sure you have tested it throughly.  Once you've
% tested it you may submit it to T-square.  Be sure all files are submitted
% with the correct filenames.
