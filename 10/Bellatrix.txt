Bellatrix Lestrange
This crazy, raving madwoman leaves death in her wake. As one of Lord
Voldemort's most trusted Death Eaters, she is often entrusted with the
dirtiest of tasks. Her latest, mad ravings include using the Cruiciatus
curse on a ministry official in his home and then killing all his family.
Death, death, death, death! That's Bella's specialty.
