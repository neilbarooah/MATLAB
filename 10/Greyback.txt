Fenrir Greyback
Fenrir Greyback is responsible for the death of a muggle in Surrey. He has
been accused of using the Cruciatus curse on multiple occassions in the
past week. Greyback used the Cruciatus curse with the muggle whose death
he is responsible for and he also used the curse with the bartender at the
Leaky Cauldron who died later that night. Sources believe Greyback was
responsible for his death as well. In addition, the death of an entire
family of wizards on Tuesday has been pinned to him. Greyback is a very
dangerous criminal who is rather important to the dark lord and he must be
apprehended before he becomes responsible for another death. Please note he
works for the dark lord so he does have a lot of support.
