Voldemort
The Dark Lord is on the rise again. He recently used the Cruciatus curse on
15 muggles he ran into on the way to the Lovegood residence before he
kidnapped Luna Lovegood. He is also responsible for the death of 10
respected wizards in the past week and the number of Death Eaters under his
command is rapidly rising as well. He must be stopped before the number of
Death Eaters grow too large to control. The Dark Lord is EXTREMELY
dangerous. We cannot have a Third Wizarding War. Voldemort clearly came 
back after the Battle of Hogwarts even though we thought he was dead. He is
stronger than we realize. We must put an end to this death and chaos.
