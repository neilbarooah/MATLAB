% PART 1.  ABC Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Part of this homework is an m-file called "ABCs_LowLevelFileIO". Open 
% these files in MATLAB and complete it according to the directions 
% contained within. 
%
% Files to Complete: 
%       - ABCs_LowLevelFileIO.m
% ABCs File Testing:
%  >> ABCs_hw08_pretest
%==========================================================================
% PART 2. Drill Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Included with this homework is a file entitled "HW08 Drill Problems.pdf",
% and included within are instructions for 5 drill problems that cover the
% following major topic(s):
%	Low Level File I/O
%
% Follow the directions carefully to write code to complete the drill
% problems as described. Make sure files names as well as function headers
% are written exactly as described in the problem text. If your function
% headers are not written as specified, then you will recieve an automatic
% zero for the problem.
%
%==========================================================================
% PART 3. Testing Your Code
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% You may use the following test cases for each problem to test your code.
% The function call with the test-inputs is shown in the first line of each
% test case, and the correct outputs are then displayed in subsequent lines
% for each test case.
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Drill Problem #1: tooManyTLAs
%
%   acro1 = tooManyTLAs('TLA1.txt')
%       acro1 => 'Left Shark is bae.'
%      
%   acro2 = tooManyTLAs('TLA2.txt')
%       acro2 => 'Help! The TAs trapped me in this computer and I can''t...
%                   get out!'
%
%   acro3 = tooManyTLAs('TLA3.txt')
%       acro3 => 'TLOK'
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Drill Problem #2: detention
%
%   result1 = detention('handCramps1.txt', ['I will never ever EVER' ...
%           ' skip class again.'])
%       result1 => 'Good job. You are free to go!'
%      
%   result2 = detention('handCramps2.txt', ['I will never curse at' ...
%           ' Matlab again while I''m at Georgia Tech.'])
%       result2 => 'Not so fast... Start all over!'
%
%   result3 = detention('handCramps3.txt', ['I will do my CS1371' ...
%           ' homework early and never waste time watching Netflix.'])
%       result3 => 'Not so fast... Start all over!'
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Drill Problem #3: phoneNumbers
%
%   [out1] = phoneNumbers('phoneList1.txt')
%       out1 => 11
%       output file named 'phoneList1_updated.txt'
%
%   [out2] = phoneNumbers('phoneList2.txt')
%       out2 => 10
%       output file named 'phoneList2_updated.txt'
%
%   [out3] = phoneNumbers('phoneList3.txt')
%       out3 => 12
%       output file named 'phoneList3_updated.txt'
%
%   NOTE: The files we provided have an additional '_soln' so that you do
%   not overwrite it with your code.  Student code will receive no credit
%   if it contains an '_soln' in the file name.
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Drill Problem #4: fauxHipster
%
%   [score1] = fauxHipster('hipConvo1.txt', 'hipLingo.txt')
%           score1 => 9
%
%   [score2] = fauxHipster('hipConvo2.txt', 'hipLingo.txt')
%           score2 => 8
%
%   [score3] = fauxHipster('hipConvo3.txt', 'hipLingo.txt')
%           score3 => 10
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Drill Problem #5: ottendorf
%
%   [out1] = ottendorf('lyrics','cipher_1.txt')
%           out1 => 'Meet under the bridge at midnight. Come alone.'
%
%   [out2] = ottendorf('quote','cipher_2.txt')
%           out2 => 'password: Bnt2nz'
